	<h3>Hill Walking<h3>
	<img src="./images/hill.jpg" id="spic" style="width:210px;margin-left:50px ;">
	<p>Walking is a perfect way to start exercising. It requires no special equipment, aside from a pair of comfortable walking shoes, and can be done anywhere. Hill walking has the added advantage of strengthing joints and legs. It also allows for variance to the walks and beautiful scenery. Our hill walks will take place in varying locations, the location of the hill walks will be posted on the noticeboard in the club one week before the walk is scheduled to take place. Members will meet at the enterance of the club and a mini bus will transport them to the start of the hill walk, this same bus will then be waiting at the end of the walk to bring them back.</p>

	<h3>Yoga</h3>
	<img src="./images/yoga.jpg" id="spic" style="width:210px; margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:0;">
	<p>Yoga is one of the best ways to improve your health, all without running, jumping or lifting anything and it makes you tangibly happier. Because there's so much room for variation (flexibility, even) in how it's practiced.</p>
	<p>Yoga can be tweaked to accommodate participants of any age, and builds strength without over-stressing joints or muscles. At Active Ove 75s we have two dedicated yoga studios and a team of professional instructors who will guide you through the sessions.</p>

	<h3>Golf</h3>
	<img src="./images/golf2.jpg" id="spic" style="width:210px;margin-left:50px ;">
	<p>The simple act of walking is one of the best ways to stay in shape, especially for senior citizens. But it can also be boring, and it's hard to motivate yourself to do anything that just isn't any fun. Fortunately, there's a sport that takes hours of walking and makes it a lot more interesting: golf. It may not be the most vigorous workout, but 9 holes of golf can leave even a fit, young person feeling sore. At active over 75s we have an award winning 9 hole golf course , and a dedicated team of golf coaches who are available for one on coaching sessions</p>
	<p>Much like for tennis, golf skills are acquired over time- so reduced strength is compensated by an improved feel for the game.</p>

	<h3>Tennis</h3>
	<img src="./images/tennis.jpg" id="spic" style="width:210px;margin-left:50px ;">

	<p>The speed and agility required to move across the court make tennis players among the most fit people on the planet.</p>
	<p>For older players, a switch from a hard court to clay can reduce stress on the knees. And while sprinting across the court to scoop up a drop shot may no longer be in the cards, veterans of the sport will still see their coordination, flexibility, balance and brain function improved. Tennis provides a fun way to get fit with a competitive edge. With four clay courts and two outdoor grass courts we are more than well equiped for you to have a great game of tennis. Tennis coaching is available on request.</p>

	<h3>Swimming</h3>
	<img src="./images/water.jpg" id="spic" style="width:210px;margin-left:50px ;">
	<p>swimming is a great way to get incredibly fit. The water provides natural resistance, which builds and tones muscles. Swimming also strengthens the heart, improves flexibility, works muscles that are largely ignored by other exercises, reduces stress and burns a whole lot of calories. If you are looking to swim lenghs or looking to participate in water aerobics, we have classes to cater to you.</P>
	

	<p>As terrific as swimming is for athletes of all ages, it has added benefits for senior citizens. The water supports the weight of the body, so stress on the skeleton is eliminated: no impact means no injuries. It can also ease arthritis along with many other health benifits. One on one or group swimming lessons are also available on request</p>

	<h3>Cycling</h3>
	<img src="./images/bike.jpg" id="spic" style="width:210px;margin-left:50px ;">
	<p>Given the benefits cycling has for your heart, mental health, immune system and calves, it's no surprise that the sport's top event, the Tour de France, draws the fittest athletes in the world. But it produces more than its fair share of elderly participants as well. Anyone who cycles regularly into older age adds years to their life expectancy. Regular exercise can reduce stress and depression and cycling is a particularly low impact activity (second only to swimming) which keeps you fit and alert. Cycling four miles daily reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by 50 per cent. It's good aerobic exercise, yet puts no load-bearing strain on joints or muscles</p>
	
	<p>At active over 75s we will select the route for our cycles and this will be posted on the club noticeboard. There are two cycle trips a week with varying difficulties each trip is led by a qualified instructor who will make sure everyone has their needs catered too.</p>
